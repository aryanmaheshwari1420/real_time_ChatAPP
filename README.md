#### 👨‍---------------------------------------------------------🎓 Things learned through this project-----------------------------------------------------

### Navigation and Routing

- Flutter Navigator is just a stack with special methods like (pushNamed, Navigator.push, etc).
- Screens/Routes are just widgets.
- Navigation from one route to another defines workflow of application.

### State Management

- Stateless/Statefull widgets.
- State is read while widget is built and can be changed using setState() for Stateful widgets.
- Helpful for seprating business code from the UI part.

### Object Oriented Approach

- Handling various function and Methods  by binding them in Class and creating Objects of them and calling through initstate().
- Reusability of Code, Reducing Redundancy.
